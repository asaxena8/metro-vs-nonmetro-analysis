# 📊 Exploring Economic Disparities in the US: Metro vs Non-Metro

This project analyzes regional economic disparities across the United States by comparing metro and non-metro areas using interactive visualizations. We explore how taxes, cost of living, education, and employment differ regionally, offering insights for policymakers, researchers, and the public.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Goal:** Investigate socioeconomic inequalities between metro and non-metro areas in the US.
- **Scope:** Focus on cost of living, unemployment, taxation, and educational attainment.
- **Outcome:** Interactive dashboard with filters, legends, and intuitive visuals using D3.js.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- 📈 **Higher Cost of Living** in metro areas, especially housing and transport.
- 💼 **Unemployment Trends** vary sharply based on location and education.
- 💰 **Tax Burden Disparities** revealed surprising trends in some rural counties.
- 🎓 **Educational Access** influences employment opportunities significantly.

## 📁 Datasets

- **US County-Level Unemployment & Education** – *Kaggle*
- **US Family Budget** – *Economic Policy Institute*

Both datasets were preprocessed and merged on the `county` field for uniformity.

## 📊 Visualizations

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🗺️ **Map with Tax Pie Charts** | Explore regional tax revenue compositions |
| 📉 **Bar Charts** | Compare cost of living (rent, food, transport, healthcare) |
| 📈 **Line Charts** | Track unemployment trends across time |
| 🎛️ **Filter Panel** | Toggle between metro and non-metro areas |
| 🎨 **Legend** | Enhances readability of visual components |

Built using **D3.js** for full control and customization.
